Vampire
=======

Vampire is an extension module for mod_python_ which provides a more
flexible dispatch mechanism for basic content handlers. Whereas the
standard mod_python handler mechanism only allows one content handler to be
associated with a whole directory when handling the content delivery phase
of servicing a HTTP request, Vampire implements a mechanism for selecting
between multiple content handlers associated with distinct resources within
a directory.

In addition to this main feature, Vampire also provides an alternative
implementation of the mod_python.publisher module along which a range of
other useful features which make using mod_python a much more pleasant
experience.

For further information about Vampire, check out the supplied articles_.
At the moment any documentation lags behind the actual code, thus you
should also consult the list of changes_ for each version as this will
often provide you with the only documentation on a new feature until
more general documentation has been completed.

If you have any questions about Vampire, it is suggested you subscribe to
the `mod_python mailing list`_ and ask your question there.
