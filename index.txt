Vampire is an extension module for mod_python_, which provides a more
flexible dispatch mechanism for basic content handlers, as well as an
alternative implementation of the mod_python.publisher module.

The main features provided by Vampire are:

- A basic content handler selection mechanism which allows unique content
  handlers to be associated with distinct resources in a directory. The
  standard mod_python handler mechanism only allows one content handler to
  be associated with a whole directory.

- A mechanism for having default content handlers triggered for different
  types of resources when no dedicated content handler exists. This
  enables a handler to be defined once for the processing of special
  files such as a ".psp" file, thereby enabling easy integration of
  third party templating systems.

- Automatic unmarshalling and passing of form data to a basic content
  handler method when a content handler defines extra arguments in addition
  to that of the request object. Previously this was only available to
  users of the mod_python.publisher module.

- An extension to the form parameter handling mechanism which through use
  of appropriate naming conventions, enables form parameters to be
  converted into structured types such as lists and dictionaries where
  appropriate.

- A user authentication mechanism for basic content handlers. Previously
  this was only available to users of the mod_python.publisher module.

- A drop in replacement to the mod_python.publisher module implementation
  which is distributed with mod_python. This implementation addresses many
  bugs which are present within the standard version as well as providing
  extra enhancements such as the ability to traverse into instances of new
  style classes. This alternative implementation also provides the same
  functionality when either mod_python 2.7.X or 3.1.X is used where as that
  supplied with mod_python behaves differently in each version.

- A version of the publisher mechanism implemented as a wrapper class which
  can be selectively applied within the context of a basic content handler.
  This allows for the mixing of the basic content handler mechanism and the
  publisher mechanism within the one directory.

- A special wrapper which can be applied to methods exported by the
  publisher mechanism, which allows additional path information to be
  supplied, with the path being passed in as a single parameter.

- A special wrapper which can be applied to methods exported by the
  publisher mechanism, which allows additional path information to be
  supplied, with the path being split into components and passed as
  separate parameters.

- A publisher like traversal mechanism for basic content handlers. This
  means that a single file can process requests for different resources
  just like publisher, but where the calling semantics are those of a
  basic content handler.

- An improved module importing and caching system which can track
  parent/child relationships between modules and will automatically
  reimport a parent module when the child module has changed. This avoids
  the constant problem in the standard mod_python module loader whereby
  Apache has to be restarted after any changes or made, or all files
  have to be touched to force reloading.

- An application configuration mechanism incorporating a dynamic search
  capability for finding an appropriate configuration file within a parent
  directory without the need to hard code relative paths into code.

- A special handler for servicing XML-RPC requests and mapping them into
  code associated with your application. This makes it possible to also
  write external scripts which can interact with your application and turn
  it into a web service.

- A template loading and caching system for the third party web templating
  engine called HTMLTemplate_.
