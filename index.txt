Vampire
=======

Vampire is an extension module for mod_python_ which provides a more
flexible dispatch mechanism for basic content handlers. Whereas with the
standard mod_python handler mechanism, one content handler is generally
associated with a whole directory when handling the content delivery phase
of servicing a HTTP request, Vampire implements a mechanism for selecting
between multiple content handlers associated with distinct resources within
a directory.

In addition to this main feature, Vampire also provides an alternative
implementation of the mod_python.publisher module along which a range of
other useful features which make using mod_python a much more pleasant
experience. For further information about Vampire, check out the supplied
articles_.

Note that the Vampire web site tends to reflect the latest working copy of
Vampire as it exists in the source code repository. As such, the
documentation on the web site may describe features which are not present
in the latest official release. In general though, the documentation lags
behind the actual code. You should therefore always consult the list of
changes_ for each version to learn about what features it supports.

If you have any questions about Vampire, it is suggested you subscribe to
the `mod_python mailing list`_ and ask your question there.
