This article details the support Vampire provides to assist in processing
HTML form parameters.


Content Handler Arguments
=========================

A traditional content handler in mod_python must accept a single argument.
The name of the argument is not important but by convention is usually
named "req". The argument will be passed the mod_python request object.
It is by using the request object that a handler is able to deliver a
response back to the client which generated the original request. If a
request provides form parameters, the handler would need to use the
"FieldStorage" class supplied with mod_python to process the request object
and obtain the form parameter values.

::

  from mod_python import apache
  from mod_python import util

  def handler(req):
    form = util.FieldStorage(req,keep_blank_values=1)
    user = form.get("user",None)
    req.content_type = "text/plain"
    req.send_http_header()
    req.write("user=%s\n"%user)
    return apache.OK

In Vampire, the manner in which arguments are defined and used in content
handlers is not the same as traditional content handlers. Instead, it is
more akin to how arguments are used in published functions when using
mod_python.publisher. That is, the argument which accepts the request
object must be called "req". Further, where a request is providing form
parameters, the form parameters will be automatically decoded and passed
through an argument of the same name.

::

  from mod_python import apache
  from mod_python import util

  def handler(req,user=None):
    req.content_type = "text/plain"
    req.send_http_header()
    req.write("user=%s\n"%user)
    return apache.OK

Where there can exist multiple form parameters, the handler would define an
argument corresponding to each. The order of the arguments is not
important. It is not even necessary that the "req" argument be the first
argument, although it is recommended. If it is necessary to catch all form
parameters, including any which weren't expected, a keyword argument list
argument can be specified.

::

  from mod_python import apache
  from mod_python import util

  def handler(req,user=None,passwd=None,**params):
    req.content_type = "text/plain"
    req.send_http_header()
    req.write("user=%s\n"%user)
    req.write("passwd=%s\n"%passwd)
    for name in params.keys():
      req.write("%s=%s\n"%(name,params[name]))
    return apache.OK

Although the treatment of arguments and automatic processing of form
parameters is the same as if using mod_python.publisher, the code within
the body of the content handler still needs to be written as for a
traditional content handler.

The only difference is that where with a traditional content handler
"apache.OK" must be returned to indicate the handler was successful, in
Vampire this is optional and returning of "None" or no explicit return
value has the same effect. In a traditional content handler, if you allow
"None" to be returned implicitly or explicitly, mod_python will raise a
HTTP internal server error as a response.


Structured Form Parameters
==========================

Traditionally, the value of any form parameter is usually a single string
value. The one exception to this is where the same form parameter name may
be repeated more than once in the input. In this case, the value will be a
list, where each successive element in the list is the value to which the
form parameter was set each time it appeared in the input.

::

  /form?name=value --> name="value"
  /form?name=value1&name=value2 --> name=["value1","value2"]

Vampire expands on this by interpreting the names of form parameters in a
special way. If form parameter names following certain conventions, it is
possible to have related form parameters be aggregated together
automatically into lists and dictionaries or even a combination of the two.
The special characters which are used to denote structure are '-' and '.'.
These are used in indicating that form parameters should be aggregated as
lists and dictionaries respectively.

To indicate that form parameters should be aggregated together as a list,
they should each be named with the same prefix and then each should in turn
be suffixed by '-' and an integer indicating its relative position in the
list in respect to other values.

::

  /form?name-1=value1&name-2=value2 --> name=["value1","value2"]
  /form?name-1=value1&name-3=value3 --> name=["value1","value3"]

The result here is not the same as a repeated form parameter, because when
there is only one such named form parameter, it will still yield a list. A
repeating form parameter of the same name, even in this form, will still
result in a list being created just for that element in the list.

::

  /form?name-1=value1 --> name=["value1"]
  /form?name-1=value1&name-1=value2 --> name=[["value1","value2"]]

To indicate that form parameters should be aggregated together in the form
of a dictionary, they should each be named with the same prefix and then
each should in turn be suffixed by '.' and the label for the element within
the dictionary.

::

  /form?name.key1=value1&name.key2=value2 --> name={'key2':'value2','key1':'value1'}

A repeating form parameter of the same name, will again result in a list
being created just for that element in the dictionary.

::

  /form?name.key1=value1 --> name={'key1':'value1'}
  /form?name.key1=value1&name.key1=value2 --> name={'key1':['value1','value2']}

The two different naming conventions for the construction of lists and
dictionaries may be combined, making it possible to create more or less
arbitrarily structured data values.

::

  /form?name.key-1=value1 --> name={'key':['value1']}
  /form?name-1.key=value1 --> name=[{'key': 'value1'}]

Because Vampire performs this special interpretation of form parameter
names, if porting code from a different system, it may be necessary to
modify the names of form parameters where they are interpreted in
unexpected ways. Alternatively, the special interpretation of form
parameter names can be disabled. This can be done by setting the
"VampireStructuredForms" option to "Off".

  PythonOption VampireStructuredForms Off

Although "vampire::publisher" is intended as a drop in replacement for
mod_python.publisher, it too by default supports this mechanism for
structured data in form values. As such, all the above applies to
"vampire::publisher", including the need to turn the feature off if so
desired.

Note that although Vampire provides the means for processing a request
and turning them into arbitrarily structured data values, no means of
performing data validation is provided by Vampire. You will need to provide
your own mechanisms for data validation or use a third party module such as
FunFormKit_.

Lazy Evaluation Of Forms
========================

When one is using mod_python.publisher, a request will always be processed
for form parameters. This causes a few problems and limits what you can use
mod_python.publisher for. Specifically, a published function can not be
used to process POST requests where the incoming content does not describe
a HTML form. You could not for example implement an XML-RPC service using
mod_python.publisher.

In addition to this limitation, if a published function performs an internal
redirect and form parameters are supplied in a POST request, the form
parameters will not be available to the target of the redirection. This is
because the request content will have been consumed by the initial processing
of the request to obtain the form parameters. It isn't possible for the
target of the redirection to read the content of the request a second time.

A similar problem to that arising from redirection is where a templating
system is used where the templating system expects to be able to do its own
processing of the form parameters. This is the case with mod_python.psp and
as such, you cannot from a published function create PSP template objects
explicitly and still expect to be able to use POST requests for providing
form parameters.

To avoid all these problems, when using Vampire content handlers a request
object will only be processed for form parameters when it is determined
there is actually a need to do so. That is, no processing will be done if
the content handler doesn't define any arguments through which form
parameters could be passed. In the case of a POST request, processing of
form parameters will also not be performed if the type of content provided
doesn't actually equate to a HTML form.

This means that provided that the only argument which is defined is that
for the "req" object, you can still implement handlers where the handler
takes responsibility for consuming and processing the actual content
contained in the request. It would also be possible to define a handler
which triggered an internal redirection to another handler which did then
make use of the ability to specify form parameters as arguments to the
handler.

Note that "vampire::publisher" performs the same as mod_python.publisher
and will always process a request object for form parameters. Thus it has
the same limitation as mod_python.publisher in respect of internal
redirects and use of third party templating systems. If you still wish to
model handlers as published functions, but need to avoid these limitations,
you will need to convert your code so as to use the "vampire.Publisher()"
handler object instead. This will work because like content handlers,
"vampire.Publisher()" will only trigger processing of form parameters if it
is actually needed.


Accessing The Form Object
=========================

When the request object is processed for form parameters, the resulting
instance of the "util.FieldStorage" class is stored in the request object
as the "form" attribute. This is compatible with where mod_python.publisher
also caches the form object. If however it were the case that a content
handler didn't define any arguments so as to cause processing of form
parameters in the first place, then the form object will not have been
created and the "form" attribute will therefore not exist.

If you wish to access the full set of input form parameters from within a
handler, or any function called from the handler, provided you have access
to the request object, you can use::

  params = vampire.processForm(req)

The dictionary returned will be the same as what would have been passed to
the content handler through the keyword argument list parameter, if the
only arguments it specified were that for the request object and the
keyword argument list parameter.

If processing of form parameters hadn't yet been performed at that point,
it will be performed at that time and will have the side effect of setting
the "form" attribute of the request object to the form object.

If prior to the call you had created your own instance of the
"util.FieldStorage", provided that you had stored it in the request object
as the "form" attribute, your instance of the form object will be used as
the basis of calculating the set of form parameters and a new one will
not be created.

The full set of form parameters will be cached within the request object in
a hidden field, thus calling "vampire.processForm()" multiple times will
still be efficient as it will return the cached set of form parameters.
