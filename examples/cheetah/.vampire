[Handlers]

# Location of the default content handlers. These are
# only consulted when the "VampireDefaultHandlers"
# option is set to "On" using the "PythonOption" setting
# in the "httpd.conf" or ".htaccess" files.


# If you want to use REST style URLs, ie., no actual
# extension on the request, ensure that setting for
# "handler" is uncommented.

# handler = %(__config_root__)s/_handler.py

# If you want to use requests with a ".html" extension,
# ensure that setting for "handler_html" is uncommented.
# It is recommended that only one of either "handler" or
# "handler_html" be active at the same time as you would
# not want both styles of URLs to work as it would be
# potentially confusing.

handler_html = %(__config_root__)s/_handler.py

# Handler which blocks access to raw Cheetah files.
