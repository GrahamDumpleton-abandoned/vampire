Hello $req.session["profile"]["fullname"].
</p>
<p>
Would you like to look at your user <a href="profile.html">profile</a>?
</p>

<p>
Or perhaps you want to <a href="$user_logout">logout</a> instead?
</p>

<p>
Note that this index page, the login form and the user profile page are all
implemented using Cheetah.
</p>
<p>
You should also check out the sample pages implemented using a
<a href="sample_1.html">handler</a>, <a href="sample_2.html">PSP</a>
and <a href="sample_3.html">HTMLTemplate</a>.
</p>
<p>
Note how you can't actually tell how they are implemented, since the
URL always uses a ".html" extension.
