Installation
============

To install Vampire, execute::

  cd software
  python setup.py build
  python setup.py install

The "install" phase may need to be done as "root", using the "sudo"
command or other means as may be appropriate for your system.

Make sure you consult the patches_ file to see if you may need to patch the
version of mod_python you are using. The patches are recommended if you are
working with a multithread MPM for Apache.
