Following people deserve credit for either providing input to Vampire
in the way of ideas or source code, either explicitly or otherwise:

  Ian Bicking - Author of code found in the file being distributed as
  "vampire/forms.py". This file was borrowed with permission from the
  FormEncode/Validator package. That package as a whole was licenced under
  the Python Software Foundation Licence and is available from
  "http://formencode.org".

  Nicolas Lehuen - Provided the initial idea for a two level locking scheme
  within the module caching system, rather than just a single lock on the
  whole module cache. This has the effect of reducing contention on the
  module cache and not unnecessarily blocking new requests while an
  unrelated module is being imported.

  Graham Dumpleton - I wrote the stuff, can't I get some credit. :-)
